   Starting on November 2017, many things were improved and simplified:

   - removed dependencies: SQLObject, C compiler, BeautifulSoup
   - removed the "mobile" and "httpThin" parsers
   - introduced a test suite (`please help with it!`_)


Main features
-------------

- written in Python 3 (compatible with Python 2.7)

- platform-independent

- can retrieve data from both the IMDb's web server, or a local copy
  of the database

- simple and complete API

- released under the terms of the GPL 2 license

IMDbPY powers many other software and has been used in various research papers.

Example
-------

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use IMDbPY:

.. code-block:: python

   from imdb import IMDb

   # create an instance of the IMDb class
   ia = IMDb()

   # get a movie
   movie = ia.get_movie('0133093')

   # print the names of the directors of the movie
   print('Directors:')
   for director in movie['directors']:
       print(director['name'])

   # print the genres of the movie
   print('Genres:')
   for genre in movie['genres']:
       print(genre)

   #Â search for a person name
   people = ia.search_person('Mel Gibson')
   for person in people:
      print(person.personID, person['name'])
